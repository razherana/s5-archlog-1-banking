Hello, I have a project in Java + Dotnet that I must code.
I need to develop a bank application.
I have these projects in different structures :
- Compte courant : Java EJB. We have an interest rate specific to the compte courant for all people.
- Compte de dépôt : Dotnet Webservice. Like compte courant but we have some conditions here. We need to let 1/2 of the money there when doing a retrait. Limited retrait, like 1 times per month. An interest rate specific to the compte de dépôt for all people.
